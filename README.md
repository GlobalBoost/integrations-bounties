# Intro to Impact Protocol
Impact Protocol is one of the first chains with a hybrid consensus mechanism. It has the power of both PoW(proof of work) and PoS(proof of stake). The Impact protocol is built on a substrate framework, and it is a modular framework that allows developers to be easy and efficient. Impact follows the thought process of building a multichain future. It will have around 100 parachains connected and running in parallel, with 10000 to 100000 transactions per second.
