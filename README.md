# Intro to Impact Protocol
Impact Protocol is one of the first chains with a hybrid consensus mechanism. It has the power of both PoW(proof of work) and PoS(proof of stake). The Impact protocol is built on a substrate framework, and it is a modular framework that allows developers to be easy and efficient. Impact follows the thought process of building a multichain future. It will have around 100 parachains connected and running in parallel, with 10000 to 100000 transactions per second.

## Integrations with impact protocol

## Description:
We offer a bounty for building variou integrations as parachains(also called impact chains) that drive adoption, usabilty for the whole impactprotocol ecosystem. This is the open track where you can build any chain that could solve some real challenges by building it own custom chain and integrate with the impact protocol. The community of developers can utilize the modular substrate framework to accomplish anything they want.

### Example project ideas:
 - Building a chain that focusses on defi 
 - Having a chain for building an Oracle
 - Chain working on Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)

### The parachain should have the following features:

 - Custom functionality: The parachain should have custom functionality that meets the needs of a specific use case or industry.

 - Efficient data transfer: The parachain should enable the efficient transfer of data and assets within the parachain network.

 - Interoperability: The parachain should be designed to be interoperable with other parachains and networks.

 - Security: The parachain should have robust security measures in place to prevent unauthorized access and ensure the safety of user funds.

 - Governance: The parachain should support governance features, including but not limited to voting and decision-making.

### Submission Requirements:
#### Create an issue presenting the idea and description of the chain you are planning to build following the similar format as shown below
 - A functional parachain that meets the above specifications and is deployed on the Polkadot network.
 - Please include in your submission’s readme file:
 - Project title
 - Project description (minimum 150 words)
 - Name of bounty
 - Name of parachain

#### Once the issue has been approved from the impact team, go ahead and start building the app and the submission requires the below artifacts
 - Clear documentation that outlines how the parachain works and how to use it.
 - Source code that is well-documented and can be easily audited by third-party developers.
 - A comprehensive testing plan that covers all aspects of the parachain.
 - Ongoing support and maintenance for a specified period of time.
 - Provide a way to access the project for judging and testing by including a link to a repo hosting the application’s code and any other deployment files and testing instructions.
 - Must have an open source license (accepted licenses here)
 - You must provide a video demo, or instructions for using your live demo
 - Language requirements: All Submission materials must be in English or, if not in English, the team must provide an English translation of any demonstration videos, text descriptions, and testing instructions as well as all other materials submitted.

### Rewards and Benefits:

Incubation and support from Impact Protocol
Eligibility for the grants and support from the team

### Judging Criteria:
#### Contribution to the Impact Ecosystem 
Includes how useful the chain is in the Impact ecosystem as a whole.

#### Originality, Creativity, and DeFi Innovation 
Includes how novel and creative the submission is versus existing technologies.

#### Technical Difficulty
Includes the level of skill or knowledge required to build the chain.

#### User Experience
Includes how intuitive and understandable the submission is for potential users or developers.

## Reward
The bounty reward for the integration depends on the importance of the parachains. It will be awarded as grant(definitely milestone based) with long term support to the team building the chain.
